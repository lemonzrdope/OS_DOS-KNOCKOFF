# mini-dos
A MS-DOS Based OS with ChatGPT making the source code.

NOTE: THIS OS IN ALPHA TESTING STAGE! I cannot guarentee that it will work 100% of the time. It may not function as intended. I have not gotten a chance to fully test and verify it will not fail or break hardware of ANY KIND.

This Page only contains code for OS not ISO. You will have to change it to function as ISO yourself. This code is written in the "C" Programming language.
